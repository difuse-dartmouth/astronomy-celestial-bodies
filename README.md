## Module Objective

Introduce students to the way Astrophysicists manipulate data and perform analyses in Python with an emphasis on data visualization and plot interpretation.

## Learning Objectives
1. Actively engage with a coding environment.
2. Analyze and compare astronomical data about different objects and/or from different observatories.
3. Interpret data visualizations in the context of course content.

## Module Description

The module aims to introduce students to the way Astrophysicists manipulate data and perform analyses with an emphasis on data visualization and plot interpretation.  Students use a sequence of python notebooks to explore, analyze astronomical data.  This module uses python notebooks as its main tool and engages students in data analysis, visualization, and drawing conclusions. 

### Data

The module pyhton notebooks pull observatory data from the Gaia star luminosity data set, a celestial object data set, TESS data on exoplanets, and the Dartmouth stellar evolution database. 


### Platform
This module uses pyhton notebooks in Google CoLab for student work.

## Course Description

[Stars and the Milky Way](http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Physics-and-Astronomy/ASTR-Astronomy-Undergraduate/ASTR-15) is an introductory astronomy course in the Physics and Astronomy Department at Dartmouth College.  It is a general introduction to astronomy and assumes no particular student background but instructors expect that about a third of students will have some python or coding background.
